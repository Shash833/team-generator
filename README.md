# Team Profile Generator

## Introduction: 

This application was created to allow the User to create a team profile (including a manager, engineers and interns). The user can generate their team profile through a series of questions about their team which are answered through the command line interface. The provided details about the team members are then used to render a HTML page. 

## Usage/Installation: 

The user must first download Node.js on their computer to use the application. After the repository is cloned from Git-Hub and relevent dependencies are installed, the user can run the application with the command "node app.js" on their terminal to display a series of questions about their team. When the user has completed providing information, they can generate their team profile.
